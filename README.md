Reverse engineered hack to enable the timelock on the Playnetic Jumpstone

The Playnetic Jumpstone is a very cool device that allows you to play MP3 music through kinetic energy; no need for wires or batteries. In order to prevent music being played the whole night long one can enable a timelock. This works very simple:
1. Edit the set.txt text file (note: "time" is the time on which you activate the timelock ie: the moment on which you will plug in the USB drive)
2. Put set.txt in the root of a USB drive (FAT32)
3. Put the USB stick in the Jumpstone at the set time
4. Start jumping on the Jumpstone untill it confirms the timelock has been uploaded
5. Remove the USB stick and insert a USB stick with MP3 songs
6. Profit!
